flex-a-sketch: Sketch App
Build a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch:
- Beginning grid size is 16x16.
- Beginning color of the drawing "pen" is black.
- The user can use a range slider to choose any grid size between 1x1 to 100x100.
- The user can choose "random" for the pen color, which then randomizes the color while drawing.
- The user can choose a specific color to use for drawing.
- If the user chooses random for the color, each colored square will darken by 10% every time the mouse crosses it.
